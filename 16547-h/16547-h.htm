<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

 </center>




  <P>We are constantly trying to make some sense of our world and the way
 people treat each other. The purpose of this book is to provide a
 systematic way of analyzing situations and planning actions.
 </P>
 <P>Sequential Problem Solving is written for those who want to reassure
 themselves that their thinking is logically correct rather than
 emotionally or impulsively misguided. It provides step by step
 procedures for applying computer-like decision making to daily living.
 Many ordinary problems involve not only physical, concrete parts but
 also interpersonal elements. Thus problem solving involves both the
 physical world and the interpersonal world. For instance, when
 solutions to physical problems are implemented, the job manager must
 decide which of several leadership-managerial styles is appropriate.
 Are the workers mature enough and knowledgeable enough to work
 together as a team without supervision, or are the workers so immature
 and unruly that an authoritarian task master leadership style will be
 required, or will the workers need a teacher-leader for some period of
time before they become a team?
</P>
 <P>The underlying principle, throughout Sequential Problem Solving, is an
 obligation to help each other as citizens of a world community, and an
 acknowledgement that our real enemy is often ourselves. Our common
 problem is understanding ourselves in order to be a friend to others.
 Sequential Problem Solving provides us with a way of checking for the
 kindness factor in problem solving, with the goal of helping others
 and being a good citizen in the world community.
 </P>
 <P>A separate section, Dealing with Unattached People, is devoted to
 the problem of neighbors in the world community who are untrustworthy
 for some period of time, from the view point that today's enemies are
  tomorrow's friends.
 </P>
 <P>Some neighbors in the world community are, from time to time,
 untrustworthy. Since opportunities for misunderstanding are greater in
 a climate of mistrust,  later sections are included that deal with
  mistrust and ways that we can gauge interpersonal situations and
 select an appropriate leadership style to match it.
  </P>
 <P>Sequential Problem Solving begins with the mechanics of learning and
  the role of memorization in learning. The techniques of effective
 memorization follow, as well as other important learning skills.
 </P>
  <P>This book contains many step by step checklists, much like pilots use
  to make certain that things of importance are not overlooked. These
  individual checklists are tied together in a broad flowchart that
  provides a sequential decision making pathway. The contents of the
  checklists are things that many adults utilize instinctively, without
  conscious thought. However these checklist can provide adults with a
  more positive way of checking their own thinking, in times of stress,
  and a way for students to become instinctive users of sound logic
 practices. Teachers may find that students instantaneously begin to
  act more mature  because of the realization that their peers have a
 common body of knowledge about values and character traits and
  checklists to evaluate  the behavior of others. For teachers, the
  sequence of presentation here can be readily altered to suit the
  teachable moment, that moment when a unique, high interest situation
 arises that lends itself to discussion of a particular topic. The
 sequence presented here is merely one way in which the various
  interlocking subjects can be presented.
  </P>
 <P>This presentation is intentionally concise to provide the reader with
  a composite picture of the use of checklists in logical thinking,
 without burdening the reader with statistical findings or repetitious
 historical background information.
  </P>
  <P>The ideas presented here are referenced to credible academic research
wherever possible. Endnotes are used extensively to direct the reader
  to in-depth authoritative resources, and additional references are
 provided for each section at the back of the book.
 </P>
 <P>In this book I have used the pronoun "he" for humanity in general,
  rather than using he/she or similar conventions. This usage was
  selected to enhance the flow of the written word and should not be
 taken literally. The word "he" is used here to include both women and
 men and applies to them with equality.
  </P>
 <P>Solving problems is a daily, if not hourly, part of our lives. It is
  therefore useful to put the mechanics of problem solving and human
  interpersonal relationships into flowchart form, so that when stress
  is intense we have some way of making more certain that we are
  thinking flawlessly. The following is such a flowchart</P>

 <a name="4"></a>
  <P>RAPID READING.</P>

  <P>Effective learners use certain reading techniques<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a>
<a href="#footnote1">[1]</a> that greatly
 increase both their comprehension and the time required to learn new
  subjects.
  </P>
 <P>One useful method of reducing new material learning time is the SQ3R
  method<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a>
<a href="#footnote2">[2]</a>:
  </P><P>   Scan.
 </P><P>   Question.
  </P><P>   Read.
  </P><P>   Review.
  </P><P>   Recite.
 </P>
 <P>Scanning provides a rapid overview. Many well written books follow
 logical outlines that can orient the reader to the subject matter.
  The outline might follow this pattern:
  </P>
  Title.<BR>
  Table of Contents.<BR>
  Main Introduction and conclusion.<BR>
  Chapter 1.<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction.<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion.<BR>
  Chapter 2.<BR>
  Chapter 3.<BR>
  Conclusion.<BR>
  Definitions.<BR>

  <P>Questioning is a natural, instinctive, second step that most learners
  follow. In the scanning process, certain questions naturally arise.
  These should be noted in a short list of questions to be answered
  through reading. The questioning procedure helps the reader stay
  focused.</P>

  <P>Reading occurs very rapidly if a systematic plan is followed:</P>

 <P>First, determine the main idea from the title, the first paragraph,
  and the last paragraph.</P>

  <P>Second, determine if a large subject is divided into smaller subjects
  with some outlining scheme.</P>

  <P>Next, follow the title, introduction, body, conclusion rule to find the main idea of each smaller section. Each smaller section can then be scanned for keywords. Keyword recognition signals the reader to pay
  closer attention for critical definitions and ideas that follow.</P>

  <P>Finally, review as often as necessary to keep focused. Outlining and
  note taking often help.</P>

  <P>Reviewing new material on a strict schedule is necessary to solidify
  new material in the memory, and to transfer it from short term memory
  to long term memory.
 </P>
 <P>Forgetfulness is a matter of periodic review. Memorization through
 repetition and forgetfulness follow a similar pattern. Each is gained
 or lost by halves for the same time period. The following graph
  illustrates the phenomenon.</P>

<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/MemoryRetention.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=400 alt="Image map" ismap>


 <P>The memory loss/recall increase with review phenomenon has been
 verified many times.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a>
<a href="#footnote3">[3]</a>
 </P>
 <P>Generally memory is lost by one-half for each doubled time increment.
  One day after first learning one-half is lost. By day two, one-half of
 that remaining memory is lost, and by day four, one-half again is
 lost. By day four, only one-sixteenth of the original memory is
 intact.
  </P>
 <P>At a similar rate, with review after one day only one-half of the
 material that was reviewed will be lost. If reviewed again on day two,
 the amount lost is again divided by two. If reviewed six &nbsp;times in a
  thirty-two day period, the about retained will be more than
 ninety-eight percent and the amount lost will only be about two
  per-cent in the next thirty-two days versus fifty per-cent in one day.</P>

  <P>&nbsp;* * * * *</P>
 <a name="5"></a>
  <P>MEMORIZATION</P>

 <P>Three common ways of remembering are: repetition, association, and
 exaggeration. <a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a>
<a href="#footnote4">[4]</a> An similar skill is outlining, and samples of
 various outlining styles can be found in Appendix 1.
 </P>
  <P>Repetition is the key to long term memory. Physiologically, when brain
 cells are activated by the memory process, the nerve cell coating,
 known as the glial sheath, increases in thickness and becomes thicker
 and thicker with each repetition, strengthening the electrical pathway
  in brain that constitutes memory. In addition, when associations
  between parts of a thing remembered are formed, the nerve cell body
  sends out axon runners to other associated memory cells. These axon
  runners from one cell connect through synapses to dendrite runners on
  other cells. As the axon-dendrite pathway is used repetitiously, the
 surrounding glial cells become larger and more tightly wrapped around
  the electrically conductive axon-dendrite pathways, thereby
  transforming the memory from a short-term memory to a long-term
  memory.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a>
<a href="#footnote5">[5]</a>
  </P>

  <IMG SRC="images/Cells.gif" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=800 alt="Image map" ismap>

  <P>Memories of similar objects reside in nearby regions of the brain,
  while memories of exotic or exaggerated objects are farther away. By
  forming memories with creative and unusual associations, many  more
  pathways are established, much like a spider weaving a bigger and
  bigger web, in which each part leads to the center by many
  interconnected pathways.
  </P>
  <P>Memory links are also established when a variety of sensations and
 muscular activity are engaged. Indeed, some people seem to be more
  proficient at learning by either seeing, hearing or writing, but no
  one method can provide the more numerous pathways provided by all
  three in combination.
 </P>
  <P>Memory is enhanced not only by repetition, but also by association and
  exaggeration of certain features of the object. Many memories are
  recalled as series of objects. For instance, a memory device to
  remember four common logical fallacies is a picture of the Earth, with
  the green continents and blue oceans, viewed from outer space with a
  flight of white geese circling around it. This image is used to recall
 the statement "geese circle every continent." The first letters of
  that statement (gcec) stand for the logic fallacies of generalization,
  circularities, either/or, and cause and effect. (These fallacies are
  discussed in detail in a later chapter.)
  </P>
  <P>Size, also, seems to play a role in memorization. During the Middle
  Ages, memory contests were held annually. In one, the winner
  remembered one hundred thousand sequential items. <a id="endnotetag6" name="endnotetag6"></a>
<a href="#endnote6">[6]</a>  A time-proven
  memory method from the Middle Ages is association of abstract ideas to
  large objects. The objects used for trigger recall seem to need to be
  about the size of a human, so that, if we were blind, we could
  identify the object by touch. Large objects in the memory seem to
  engage muscular memory areas as well as sight memory areas in the
  brain and expand the memory web. For instance, remembering the points
  of a speech about a military battle might involving walking from one
  room to another in a familiar house. In the first room a ship's anchor
  is propped up in a corner, in the next room is a cannon, in the third
  room is a large telescope, and the in the fourth room is a horse. This
  sequence of anchor, cannon, telescope, horse might remind the speaker
  that the speech is about a ship being bombarded from the shore by a
  cannon; and that the cannon was captured when a scouting party saw the
  cannon through a telescope and sent for the cavalry.
  </P>
  <P>Imagining numbers as objects in three-dimensional space is a very
  powerful way of remembering a series of numbers. This also seems to
  engage muscular memory. For instance, we might imagine  block numbers
  for Pi, 3.1416. These numbered blocks should be about four inches high
  and one inch thick and should be imagined rotating in space about two
  feet to the front and about six inches above eye level. We can imagine
 them rotating slowly in a circle through an entire revolution. As they
  turn, we can mentally reach out and feel them with our fingers on
  every side. Such exercises, involving three-dimensional objects in
  space and muscles,  allow the associated memory cells to form many,
  many more links than just a single glance at written numbers will
  form. Additional associations not only form more axon-dendrite
  connections, but also cause an increase in the surrounding glial
  sheath of the brain cell.

 <P>PRACTICAL PROBLEM SOLVING
 </P>

 <P>Sequential Problem Solving is a labor of love for all students who
 seek success and for the parents and teachers who guide them.
 Sequential Problem Solving also provides the lifelong-learner with the
  satisfaction of being able to measure his performance.

  </P>
 <P>The goal of Sequential Problem Solving is to provide learners with a
road map for successfully making decisions. Students can began their
adult lives with a framework that will help them pick noble goals,
know themselves, and be prepared for dealing with life's villains.
They can thus achieve peace and joy, and can be prepared for making
life's hard decisions as well.
</P>
<P>Young people often dream of a loving spouse and joyful children. Older
people dream of success in business. Still others dream of securing  a
suitable retirement. Whatever the age or the dream, the problems, of
making dreams come true, share some similarities.
</P>
<P>People solving problems share certain common steps in resolving those
problems and face certain common difficulties. How do we develop
solutions? Where do we get information to work with? Who should we
trust for advise? At what point should we make a decision? What are
the alternatives?
</P>
<P>Study leads to success, and organization builds bridges to the future.
Organized systematic thinking requires effort, and the effort is
justified by predictable success. This is contrasted to happenstance
decision making based on impulsiveness and wishful thinking.
Sequential Problem Solving is about organized thinking, and justifying
decisions based on solid facts, rather than on impulsiveness or
emotional indulgence. Growing to maturity is about planning rather
than acting on impulses or instant gratification. Instant
gratification often has costly consequences that forethought might
have averted. Sequential Problem Solving is about making dreams come
true while minimizing the hidden costs.
</P>
<P>I remember well the magic of that first romantic glance across a
crowded ballroom, the guileless smile and downcast eyes that
instantaneously made my heart skip a beat. I remember the soul
stirring melody of  <I>Band of Gold</I> and the lingering smell of peaches
and the gentle winds against my ears on a pleasant summer night.
Sequential Problem Solving is about memories and dreams, making them
come true, and keeping them alive.
</P>
<P>Sequential Problem Solving is about becoming both a success and a
lifelong-learner. Problem solving has two aspects: physical problems
in a scientific environment and personal problems in a spiritual inner
world. This book uses well known classical literary selections as
models for personal decision making and character development. These
works were chosen primarily due to their ready availability.
</P>
<P>Part of the fun of sequential problem solving is mentally rewriting
stories to have  more favorable outcomes. We imagine favorable
outcomes naturally, but successful people do so in a more systematic
fashion, that makes logical outcomes more certain. Using realistic
logic rather than wishful emotion requires that we know ourselves,
know our values and where they came from, and know clearly what our
basic goals are in life. Sequential Problem Solving systematically
outlines those aspects of our spiritual inner selves that play a part
in our decision making and, largely, determine our success.
</P>
<P>Sequential Problem Solving explores the nature of personal internal
conflict and how literary characters change in the course of stories
to overcome personal weaknesses. Successful learners learn to
recognize their own internal conflicts and learn that courage is a
skill anyone can learn to re-direct their own destiny.
</P>
<P>The first step in the adventure of becoming courageous is to write
down a philosophy of life: what we want to achieve and how we plan to
treat other people. A few words will do: I want to be happy, healthy,
wealthy, have a loving companion, help others, etc.
</P>
<P>Everyone should develop, write down, and periodically review their
philosophy of life. If we are going to be successful, we need to have
a systematic way of going about it. What do we know today about
effective ways of becoming educated and successful?
</P>
<P>At this point in time, my own philosophy for education has 11 parts.
</P>
<P>First, learning has three basic components: specialized knowledge,
basic thinking skills, and mature thinking skills.<a id="endnotetag7" name="endnotetag7"></a>
<a href="#endnote7">[1]</a> In the study of
Dickens' <I>Great Expectations</I>, "specialized knowledge" includes Pip's
turbulent relationship to his sister and to her husband Joe. "Basic
thinking skills" include the student's memorization of the various
characters and the sequence of the plot in the story. "Mature thinking
skills" include the student's analysis of Pip's internal conflict and
how Pip overcomes his internal weaknesses. Mature skills  might also
include the creation of an alternative ending of how the story could
have achieved an even more satisfactory ending. This story is unique
in that there are two published endings: one, the author's original
ending, and the second written at the insistence of the author's
newspaper editor. These alternative endings illustrate how we can
create an alternative environment and make our dreams come true.
Sequential Problem Solving is about finding alternative solutions to
problems and executing well researched plans.
</P>
<P>Second, students learn to trust their own ability through success, and
the teacher can help to insure that success. Success can be assured by
tailoring the curriculum to the student. The student with severe prior
knowledge deficits can usually be rapidly remediated by learning basic
thinking skills first: for instance, the basic memorization
techniques, note taking, outlining, and free association recall
techniques. (These are discussed in detail elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>Students should be aware of  what they learn and feel pride of
accomplishment. They should recognize for themselves when  they
achieve success in learning. They should learn to constantly monitor
their own performance and the success of their strategies.
</P>
<P>Learning occurs in well ordered ways:<a id="endnotetag8" name="endnotetag8"></a><a href="#endnote8">[2]</a>  first, the student gains
understanding of what is read or the teacher explains, then memorizes
the facts of the subject in order to analysis the information later
through comparing and contrasting. Next the student may use the
information to create something new, and finally he should use the
memorized information to evaluate his own performance. This sequence
is known to teachers as Bloom's taxonomy. <a id="endnotetag9" name="endnotetag9"></a><a href="#endnote9">[3]</a>
</P>
<P>Students need guidelines for making decisions. Those decisions may
involve physical, scientific problems, or they may involve
interpersonal problems, social values and moral decisions. Students
should learn a systematic workable framework for making decisions. All
students should develop the ability to evaluate their thought
processes as a learned skill. The mature learner should be able to
recall the steps of scientific problem solving, recognize specific
personal values and character traits,  and remember the tests for
sequential steps in moral decision making. Students should then be
able to use apply those mature thinking skills to first literary
scenarios and then to real life problems. Studies of literature enable
the student to extend the analysis to television drama and ultimately
to real life and to subsequently imagine a variety of suitable
alternative outcomes.
</P>
<P>Students should learn to recognize and control certain biological
feelings. A student should know how the human brain is organized and
recognize those times when animal-like impulses jeopardize more
mature, rational thought. A student should also be able to recall and
use basic information about basic nutrition, rest, and exercise, in
order to minimize the danger of thoughtless impulsiveness.
</P>
<P>Students should develop a sense of belonging to a caring, helpful
humanity, and develop their own short and long term goals in achieving
peace and joy through helping others in a responsible manner.
</P>
<P>Students should learn the dynamics of basic childcare and the
importance of continuous parental attachment in the first two years of
a baby's life. Students should be aware of how "unattached" children
are set up for failure and antisocial behavior disorders, by poor
bonding with the parent in the first few months and years of life.
</P>
<P>Students should be prepared to deal with manipulative people. Students
should learn how to recognize people without a conscience. Students
should have strategies for managing interpersonal relationships, both
good and bad.
</P>
<P>Students should have a knowledge of the religions of the world and
develop a toleration for other people.
</P>
<P>Finally, students should become citizens of the world, dedicated to
helping others while making their own dreams come true.
</P>
<P>Developing and maintaining a systematic philosophy of life entails
becoming a lifelong learner.
</P>

LEARNING.
<BR>

<P>Learning has three basic components: specialized knowledge, basic
thinking skills, and mature thinking skills.
</P>
<P>Specialized knowledge is that part of  a study that must be memorized.
This "disciplinary based knowledge" contains unique terms and
definitions. Language studies have their unique terms: nominative,
comma, plot;  mathematics has its: tangent, sum, parabola, etc. These
are terms that must be memorized in order to understand and use the
subject matter.
</P>
<P>Basic thinking skills include memorization techniques, the stream of
consciousness technique, outlining, note taking, rapid reading,
scanning for main ideas and keywords, questioning, and reorganizing.
</P>
<P>Mature thinking skills include procedures that require specialized
knowledge and basic thinking skills, like applying the sequential
steps of problem solving and following the sequential tests for moral
decision making.
</P>
 * * * * *
<BR><BR>

<a name="8"></a>
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS
<BR>

<P>Both creative writers, artists and scientific problem solvers use the
stream of consciousness or free-association skill. This skill is also
known as gestation, mulling things over, and getting a handle on
things. The process begins by letting our thoughts flow freely and
then sorting out the ones useful to our problem from the many that
 came to mind. Often many of the random thoughts that come to mind have
no apparent connection to the problem; they are merely connected like
circular links in a spider's web to threads that interconnect with
others and run toward the center of the problem. The free association
technique begins by trying to think about nothing in a relaxed,
tension-free environment. Try as we might, something always intrudes
on our consciousness. It may  a line running toward the center of the
web or it may be a seemingly  meaningless, circular line. Every
thought should be written down as it comes to mind, and the task of
thinking about nothing begun anew. After ten or fifteen minutes, the
train of intrusive thoughts usually begins to slow down, and we can
then take the list of seemingly unrelated thoughts and sort out the
ones that relate to the problem. The next step of brainstorming is to
take the free association / stream of consciousness list and circle
the words that pertain to the problem, and connect them with "web"
lines into "clusters." These crude webs and clusters can then be
reconstructed into a more legible outline. (Several styles of
outlining are illustrated in the Appendix 2.) This outline can then be
used in the subsequent steps of problem solving. The subsequent steps
of the problem solving procedure involve hypothetico-deductive
reasoning and is a part of  the scientific method.<a id="endnotetag10" name="endnotetag10"></a><a href="#endnote10">[4]</a>

PROBLEM SOLVING STEPS.
<BR><BR>

1. Identify the problem (state the hypothesis).
<BR><BR>

2. Gather facts: three ways in the order of most reliability.
 <BR>

<P> A. Research&mdash;library, Internet.
</P>

<P>B. Ask someone knowledgeable.
</P>

<P>C. Brainstorm: free association / stream of consciousness, web and
cluster, outline.</P>


3. Develop several alternative solutions.
<BR><BR>


4. Pick a possible solution and try it.
<BR><BR>


5. Evaluate the outcome.
<BR><BR>


6. Try again if necessary
<BR><BR>

  * * * * *
<a name="10"></a>
 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION.<BR>
<BR>

<P><I>Problem Identification</I> is the first step of problem solving.
In life, personal problems are often complicated by outside
challenges. In literature, these forces are called external conflicts.
The external conflict may be man challenged by nature,  man embattled
by society,  or one man opposed by  another man. In science, problems
are often exclusively matters of a physical nature and the external
conflict is man being challenged by nature.

</P>
<P>Internal conflicts have a personal nature. By comparing personal
internal conflicts to Aristotle's structure for dramas, these
conflicts can often be recognized. Aristotle's drama structure divided
the play into five acts with a hero, a villain, an external conflict
and climax, and an emotional cleansing involving an internal conflict.
Real life internal conflicts often involve character traits and values
that are easily identified by this method.<a id="endnotetag11" name="endnotetag11"></a><a href="#endnote11">[5]</a>  (Character traits and
values are discussed in the section on interpersonal relationships.)
</P>
  * * * * *
<BR><BR>

<a name="11"></a>
FACT GATHERING IN PROBLEM SOLVING.
<BR>

<P>The preferred order for gather facts is based on the order of
reliability: library research, asking someone knowledgeable, and
brainstorming.
</P>
<P>Facts should be tested for logic, emotional fallacies, and the
credibility of "expert" witnesses. Facts gained from research in a
library are easiest to verify, and other methods of gathering facts
must often be re-verified through library research.  Logical  and
emotional weaknesses of arguments can often be recognized by the use
of certain fallacy recognition checklists.<a id="endnotetag12" name="endnotetag12"></a><a href="#endnote12">[6]</a>  The most widely used of
the fallacies is the over or under generalization: everyone (all,
without exception, none, never, no one) rode a bicycle when only two
years old.<a id="endnotetag13" name="endnotetag13"></a>
<a href="#endnote13">[7]</a>
</P>
 * * * * *
<BR>

The more common persuasive fallacies are:
<BR><BR>
<a name="12"></a>

LOGIC FALLACIES.
<BR><BR>


1. GENERALIZATION&mdash;It is raining everywhere. It has not rained
anywhere. (The exception is discounted.)
<BR><BR>

2. CIRCULAR ARGUMENT&mdash;That team is the best because it is the
greatest. (Similar adjectives describing each other.)
<BR><BR>

3. EITHER-OR fallacy&mdash;Either the city will drill more wells or it
will run out of water. (This ignores the possibility of water
pipelines, river dams,  desalinization, etc.)
<BR><BR>

4. CAUSE AND EFFECT fallacies&mdash;two kinds:
<BR>

     <P>A. SINGLE CAUSE fallacy&mdash;The streets are wet, therefore it has
been snowing.(This discounts other causes like rain.)
</P>

    <P>B. GUILT BY ASSOCIATION&mdash;He has a friend that is a Japanese,
therefore he must be Japanese in his soul.

</P>
 * * * * *
<BR><BR>
<a name="13"></a>
EMOTIONAL FALLACIES. (These are intended make a person fear loss of
friendship.)<a id="endnotetag14" name="endnotetag14"></a>
<a href="#endnote14">[8]</a>
<BR><BR>

1. GENERALIZATION&mdash;Everyone is doing it.
<BR><BR>

2. SNOB APPEAL&mdash;A special thing for a special group: Heroes
wear only Hot Stuff clothes.
<BR><BR>
3. LOADED LANGUAGE&mdash;Emotionally connotative terms of derision: He is
a "Mutt." (Not only a dog but also a worthless cur.)
<BR><BR>

4. NAME CALLING&mdash;This is often used to discredit someone.
It is also often a problem evasion rather than a problem solving
strategy that uses:
<BR><BR>

   <P> i. SARCASM.
</P>

   <P>ii. CYNICISM.
</P>
 * * * * *
<BR><BR>
<a name="14"></a>
CREDIBILITY FALLACIES.
<BR><BR>

 <P>Credibility fallacies are those in which uncertified people present
themselves as experts: the famous actor dressed as a doctor
recommending a certain medicine. The actor is not a trained
professional and has no professional credibility.
</P>
<a name="15"></a>

FACT AND OPINION.
<BR>

<P>Certain keywords can be often be used to differentiate facts from
opinions.
</P>
1. Generalizations. All inclusive or all exclusive terms that usually
have exceptions: everyone, everything, no one, never, always:
<BR>

<P>It always rains in the summertime. (This does not take into account
long droughts or geographic locations where rain rarely falls.)
</P>
<P>Everyone drives a Ford.</P>


2. Statements about the future:
<BR>

<P>We will never go there.</P>

3. Statements of opinion:
<BR>

<P>It seems to me.
</P>
<P>In my opinion.
</P>
4. Statements using the emphatic "to be" words. Is, are, was, were,
etc. are often facts that can be proven either true or false, but are
not necessarily as true as the "is" implies.
<BR>

<P>He is a genius.
</P>
<P>For the purpose of gathering information in problem solving, facts are
statements that can be readily  verified as true or false; opinions
cannot be quickly verified. In problem solving, the practical ability
to prove something true without a great deal of effort is the key to
practical truth. A statement that might merely hold the possibility of
being proven true is, for all practical purposes, an opinion until it
is proven true.
</P>
  * * * * *
<BR><BR>

<a name="16"></a>
DEDUCTIVE REASONING ERRORS
<BR><BR>


<P>Deductive reasoning <a id="endnotetag15" name="endnotetag15"></a>
<a href="#endnote15">[9]</a> is stating a series of valid relationships
with a conclusion about them:
</P>
<P>When it rains the streets get wet. It is raining. Therefore the
streets are wet.
</P>
<P>Several types of reasoning fallacies exist:  (1) formal deductive
fallacies, which occur because of an error in the form of the
argument, and (2) informal fallacies that contain false content.
</P>
<P>The INFORMAL FALSE CONTENT FALLACIES are listed in Appendix 4 and
include:
</P>
LOGIC ERRORS.<BR>
<BR>


* The "straw man" deception.<BR>
<BR>


* The "false dilemma" deception.<BR>
<BR>


* The "Domino Theory" deception.<BR>
<BR>


* The "two wrongs make a right fallacies" deception.<BR>
<BR>


EMOTIONAL ERRORS.<BR>
<BR>


* The "attack the speaker" diversion.
<BR>
<BR>

* The "commonly accepted practice" deception.
<BR>
<BR>

* The "appeal to pity" tactic.
<BR>
<BR>

* The "infallible truth or cliche" deception.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>The emotional tactics often include cynicism or sarcasm and are
sometimes used to belittle another person. The effect is to make them
feel worthless and unloved. This is an emotional fallacy that attacks
a person's need for love and belonging. <a id="endnotetag16" name="endnotetag16"></a>
<a href="#endnote16">[10]</a> This is discussed in greater
detail in the section on Internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>Sometimes debaters attempt to evade answering an argument using the
"red herring" diversion. This tactic was named for game poachers that
used a strong smelling fish to mask their scent from dogs used by
game wardens trying to apprehend them. This tactic introduces another
issue that diverts the discussion. It is often  logically unrelated to
the issue, and is often an emotional attack directed at the other
person.

=============================<BR>
<BR>

<a name="17"></a>
DEVELOPING A SOLUTION.

<P>Developing solutions should take into account time, material and
manpower. How much time is available to solve a problem? Are the
materials available? Is the manpower available?
</P>
<a name="18"></a>
TIME.

<P>How much time is available? Often problems are best solved by using
"Kentucky windage." Artillery gunners use the expression, "One over,
one under, one dead center." This refers to making gross adjustments
rather than walking a solution toward a problem one small step at a
time. This technique has also been called "Eliminating the extremes":
walking toward the center from either end, half way at a time. This
technique reduces the time required to solve a problem in a binary
fashion by halves, rather than in arithmetic progression one small
step at a time.
</P>
<P>Often the first solutions tried don't work. We may learn more facts
about problems as we try to solve them. Many times a problem requires
re-defining and the entire nature of the solution changes from one
trial to the next. In science, every experiment is valuable because
what is disproven is as valuable as the final solution. A disproven
solution reduces the possibilities by providing answers about what is
not possible.
</P>
<P>We need to take into account problems that will arise. It is useful to
double or triple the initial time estimate when beginning new
projects. It is prudent to plan on finishing the job in one-third to
one-half of the time we would like to finish the job. This is
particularly true with artistic projects; artists often want to add
one final touch, and one more touch ad infinitum (the "Michelangelo"
dilemma).
</P>
<P>Timing for the various elements in a job can often be charted
beginning with the first thing needed to be done and ending with a
review of the project and future planning. Such charts are easily
constructed on spreadsheets with calendar dates in vertical columns
and tasks in horizontal rows. This form of time chart is a
marching calendar. Initially, the chart can also be used to back
schedule material purchase for future delivery.  As sequential tasks
are completed, the consecutive days are highlighted. This provides a
rapid visualization to the project planners of the status of the
project.

Sometimes it is possible to make an "first piece" or  "practice piece"
out of inexpensive materials. Practice pieces are helpful to learn
practical manufacturing methods. Producing detailed drawings and
listing manufacturing steps often save time and material in the long
run. Practice pieces made of soft and easy to work material, like
balsam wood, also serve the purpose of providing an actual mock up
that can be quickly modified by cut and paste methods. The practice
piece usually does not have to be pretty, only functional. It provides
an idea of what changes need to be made before expensive or hard to
procure materials are used.</P>

TRYING THE SOLUTION.<BR>

<P>Often complex or new tasks become learning projects, in themselves, to
try to more accurately identify the problem, and to gather sufficient
facts through failure in experimentation to make progress. Projects
should include ongoing evaluation and re-planning. Old World
craftsmen, the master craftsmen of yesteryear, had a guiding principle
that continues to have merit: "Any job worth doing is worth doing
well." Doing a job well often means making a final copy after revising

MANPOWER MANAGEMENT.<BR>
<BR>


<P>Leaders should remember that several approaches to leadership are
available. No one style is satisfactory for all situations.
</P>
 * * * * *<BR>
<BR>

<a name="23"></a>

LEADERSHIP STYLES.<BR>
<BR>


<P>Three basic leadership styles exist. They are the authoritarian model,
the teacher  model, and the team work model.<a id="endnotetag18" name="endnotetag18"></a>
<a href="#endnote18">[1]</a></P>

<P>The authoritarian model is useful for situations requiring immediate
compliance by a subordinate. Soldiers occasionally use the
authoritarian style to demand instant obedience. It is most useful in
dangerous situations where hesitation in complying might be
disastrous; for instance, when a child is daydreaming and in danger of
walking off of  a sidewalk curb into automobile traffic. In business
situations, this style is not often used because the authoritarian
leader is often destined to fail:  "micro-management" often has a
belittling effect on subordinates, who subsequently rebel, and failure
follows for three reasons: the authoritarian leader often doesn't have
the expertise, time, or enough energy  to do all of the jobs himself
job without other's help. The authoritarian leadership style is seldom
useful except in emergency situations.<a id="endnotetag19" name="endnotetag19"></a><a href="#endnote19">[2]</a> (It has been said that a
raised voice with someone older than five is usually inappropriate.)
</P>
<P>The teaching leadership model is more useful because the people doing
the job are contributors. The teacher offers advice and monitors
progress.<a id="endnotetag20" name="endnotetag20"></a><a href="#endnote20">[3]</a>
</P>
<P>The team work leadership model is sometimes the most useful. This
model works when the students become as knowledgeable as the teacher
and each can and will do the other's job. This model is often seen
when someone realizes a job needs doing, and does it without being
told to do it. These people are conscientious "self-starters."

DEALING WITH INTERPERSONAL CONFLICT.<BR>
 <BR>


<P>Western World values and ideas of dealing with interpersonal conflict
originate in the Code of Hammarabi and the Mosaic Code.
</P>
<P>King Solomon in the Bible, following the Ten Commandments of Moses,
offers some practical suggestions for dealing with interpersonal
conflict.
</P>
<P>In Solomon's Book of Proverbs, one of Solomon's main themes is drawing
a consistent distinction between the wise man and the foolish man.  He
characterizes a foolish man as someone who neither asks for advise nor
accepts it. He further characterizes the foolish man as someone who is
scornful, divisive, quarrelsome, and mocking of other's efforts with
cynicism and sarcasm.
</P>
<P>Solomon's advise for dealing with scornful people has three steps. The
first step is to try counseling with them in private, one on one.
Failing that, the second step is to counsel with them again, but with
two people, together, advising the third. The final step is to cease
relations.
</P>
<P>Solomon's three steps are seen today in practical statesmanship. We
should remember that today's enemy is tomorrow's friend. Member
nations of the United Nations generally apply this same three-step
plan that ends in economic sanctions being applied by the United
Nations as a whole. Sometimes even ceasing relations with another is
not enough and force of arms must be taken to protect weaker neighbors
from aggression.
</P>
<P>Whether with neighbors or nations, armed conflict is ultimately
sorrowful. It is an admission that patient diplomacy and logic have
not been successful. It is premeditated violence to protect the weak.
Many people, still developing in religious maturity and understanding,
feel torment when violence is necessary, because their religious
understanding does not extend beyond helping "all" others. It is a
question of who is helped and why. Some people too choose to pass from
this life as martyrs. Others feel compelled to stay until the end and
protect the weak like a shepherd keeping predatory dogs away from the
helpless lambs. There may be a time for each course of action.
</P>
<P>The confusion between religion and forcing our will on others is
caused by our understanding of what helping others means. If we help
others to hurt someone, we become harmful ourselves. We become
"Enablers" <a id="endnotetag21" name="endnotetag21"></a>
<a href="#endnote21">[1]</a> to those hurting others. Without our consent, the
aggressor could not have taken advantage of his weaker neighbor.
</P>
<P>The Eastern religions, particularly Zen Buddhism, which is intimately
associated with the Samurai warrior of Japan, take great care to teach
tranquility and self-control in the use of force. Anger is not a part
of thoughtful action.
</P>
<P>Aikido, The Way of Harmony, teaches tranquility in the use of force,
and compares it to the calm in the eye of a hurricane.<a id="endnotetag22" name="endnotetag22"></a><a href="#endnote22">[2]</a>
</P>
<P>The great Christian pastor, Dietrich Bonhoffer, pointed out that "just
causes"  for anger  did not exist in the earliest accounts of Christ's
Sermon on the Mount.<a id="endnotetag23" name="endnotetag23"></a><a href="#endnote23">[3]</a></P>

INTERPERSONAL PROBLEM SOLVING:<BR>
<BR>



<P>Drama and literary analysis as a tool in personal problem solving.</P>


<P>The structure of Aristotle's Pentad
<a id="endnotetag24" name="endnotetag24"></a><a href="#endnote24">[1]</a>
for five act plays is useful as a framework for solving personal problems.</P>

1. Who is the hero? What are his weaknesses? How is he likely to
fall?
<BR>
<BR>

2. Who is the villain? Is the villain another person, nature or
society?
<BR>
<BR>

3. What external events lead to the climax with the villain?
<BR>
<BR>

4. How does the climax with the villain turn out?
<BR>
<BR>

5. What did the hero learn about his own internal weaknesses in the
encounter with the villain?
<BR>
<BR>

<P>This five part framework is useful in separating the external foes we
face from the internal conflicts that are our weaknesses.
</P>
<a name="26"></a>
EXTERNAL CONFLICTS.<BR>
<BR>


<P>External conflicts are usually found to involve either another man,
nature or society. In the man versus man conflict, another person is
the adversary. In the man versus nature conflict, the adversary might
be a hurricane, or the rigors involved in climbing a mountain. In the
man versus society conflict, the opponent might be industrial
organizations or lobby groups advocating nuclear waste disposal in the
ocean.</P>

<P>The man versus self conflict, such as a man facing a crisis of
courage, is an internal conflict.
</P>
<a name="27"></a>
INTERNAL CONFLICTS.<BR>
<BR>


<P>Internal conflicts are man versus himself and man versus God
conflicts.
</P>
<P>The man versus God occurs when a person violates his conscience and
does something that he knows to be wrong. Many religions advocate
resolving the man versus God conflict by admission of wrongdoing and
restitution to those harmed. There may be some people that have no
conscience, and the internal conflicts they face are not, as yet,
well understood.<a id="endnotetag25" name="endnotetag25"></a>
<a href="#endnote25">[2]</a> Those people without a conscience are a continuing
source of grief for humanity and that problem is discussed in the
section on dealing with "unattached people."
</P>
<P>The second type of internal conflict, the man versus self conflict
exhibit certain human character weaknesses that can be identified with
the acronym FALL: fear, arrogance, laziness, and loneliness.
</P>
<P>Loneliness is often caused by a combination of several of the other
three common human weaknesses, for instance, fear and laziness: fear
of rejection while trying to find new friends and laziness in making
the attempt.
</P>
<P>Fear is a very common weakness and is related to our needs. Abraham
Maslow<a id="endnotetag26" name="endnotetag26"></a><a href="#endnote26">[3]</a> classified these needs as follows:
</P>
1. Physical safety.<BR>
<BR>
2. Food and shelter.<BR>
<BR>
3. Love or belonging&mdash;the need to love and be loved.<BR>
<BR>
4. Career&mdash;the need to be successful at something.<BR>
<BR>
5. Self actualization&mdash;the need some people feel to become who God
wants them to be.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>People must meet their immediate, basic needs for physical safety
before they can meet their wishful needs for love or fulfilling a
career. While we strive to behave as thinking people, with well
thought out plans, sometimes we act purely as animals by instinct
alone. If we are suddenly frightened by a snarling dog, we react by
running or fighting, instinctively, without conscious thought. Paul
MacLean describes what happens in our brains as a stepping down the
evolutionary ladder and using those parts of our "Triune" brain that
operates on instinct rather than thought.<a id="endnotetag27" name="endnotetag27"></a>
<a href="#endnote27">[4]</a>
</P>
<P>MacLean divides the Triune brain<a id="endnotetag28" name="endnotetag28"></a>
<a href="#endnote28">[5]</a> into three parts that developed
over the evolutionary eons. The oldest, which he calls the reptilian
brain, controls aggression and passionate impulsiveness. The middle
region, the limbic system, controls docile, loving emotions. The outer
region, the neo-cortex controls thoughtful planning with an awareness
of consequences and cause-effect relationships. This phenomenon is
important because fear alone can inhibit successful higher level
thinking by keeping the brain at the lowest (reptilian) level
preparing to meet the threat. The educator Lev Vygotsky stressed the
importance of creating and maintaining a risk-free environment that
encourages higher level (neo-cortex) thought. <a id="endnotetag29" name="endnotetag29"></a>
<a href="#endnote29">[6]</a>  The growing
recognition of the Triune Brain might very well have influenced world
politics in the replacement of the policy of "mutually assured
destruction" with a "kinder and gentler" statesmanship.
</P>
<P>Maslow's need and MacLean's brain are both related to animal-like
behavioral weaknesses when we react impulsively rather than with
thought and planning, and we are more likely to act impulsively when
our physical safety or food and shelter needs are threatened.
</P>
<P>When we do act like animals, we often are ashamed because we
momentarily set aside our conscience. Fear overpowers our desire to be
loving because it engages lower brain centers that are not controlled
by abstract thought centers in the higher levels of our brain.
</P>
<P>How then can we act like we are created in the image of God instead of
selfish, impulsive animals? We can begin by analyzing what characters
in literature and drama do. We can recognize when fear, arrogance,
laziness, or loneliness drives the hero's actions, and imagine how the
hero might overcome his weaknesses. We can  project a responsible
resolution to the hero's internal conflicts. This exercise of
recognizing the source of another's actions is merely an intermediate
step in the learning process, however.<a id="endnotetag30" name="endnotetag30"></a>
<a href="#endnote30">[7]</a> The final step is when we
face our own trails, and face the need to analyze our own reactions to
stress, as we have looked at those in dramas. Finally, we can plan our
own future and make it happen, just as we did with alternative endings
to conflicts in dramas.
</P>
<P>Occasionally,  people face moral choices that seem to confusing to be
solved, and the thinking brain tries to step down a notch. It either
takes a passive emotional position with MacLean's limbic system, or an
impulsive aggressive position with the reptilian system. At these
times, a checklist for moral decision making can provide a framework
for keeping our actions in the realm of planned activity rather than
impulse.
</P>
<a name="28"></a>
THE STEPS OF MORAL DECISION MAKING.<BR>


<P>Moral decision making involves several growth steps in reaching
maturity.
</P>

<P>Stanley Kohlberg <a id="endnotetag31" name="endnotetag31"></a>
<a href="#endnote31">[8]</a> provided us with a framework for making moral
decisions:</P>
Age &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question.<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punishment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I get caught?<BR>
<BR>

10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Rule &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would I like to treated?<BR>
<BR>

13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone Rule &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would the world be like if everyone
made this same decision?<BR>
<BR>

15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater Good Rule &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this decision produce the greatest
good for the greatest number?<BR>
<BR>

Adult &nbsp;&nbsp;Higher Authority Rule &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this what God wants me to do?<BR>
<BR>



<P>Religious people often experience great internal conflict when faced
Many religions advocate gentleness and helping others, as well as
protecting the weak from harm: a seeming contradiction. Does one have
priority over the other? Part of the answer may involve the Triune
brain and the absence of thought involved in impulsive aggression.
Sometimes helping others may involve protecting violent people from
themselves and that may require the use of force. Often gentle, kind
people find the use of force quite foreign, and are especially
vulnerable to harm from people that are termed "unattached." <a id="endnotetag32" name="endnotetag32"></a>
<a href="#endnote32">[9]</a>
</P>
<a name="29"></a>
DEALING WITH THE "UNATTACHED" PERSON.<BR>


<P>"Unattached" people refers to people that have a defective
conscience. <a id="endnotetag33" name="endnotetag33"></a><a href="#endnote33">[10]</a> Their actions are motivated by a lifelong distrust of
others and a supreme belief in their own ability. They have no need for
other people. Their brains seem to function at a very low evolutionary
level, but at times they are superficially charming and persuasive.
These people are manipulative and often become sociopaths, and their
behavior is thought to have been molded before they were six months
of age by insufficiently attentive caretakers.
</P>
<P>"Unattached" people, people who bonded inadequately with their
parents, are frequently very hard to convince with logical arguments
due to their deep distrust of other people and the pattern of control battles continue throughout their lifetime. <a id="endnotetag34" name="endnotetag34"></a><a href="#endnote34">[11]</a> This sad picture is drawn from the experiences of those professionals who deal with them on a regular
basis. The sociopath's irreversible behavior patterns seems to be
founded, physiologically, in well established repetitive memory
pathways. Perhaps modern science will find ways to help such
unfortunate people, possibly through more effective chemical
intervention that makes a person feel less threatened, so that they
can learn more productive way of treating other people.
</P>
<P>Mercifully, some spiritually enlightened people are able to reach older
"Unattached" people and to help them to learn to trust others and
achieve that measure of "peace that surpasses all understanding" spoken
of by the Apostle Paul in his Letter to the Phillipians in chapter 4,
verse 7: "And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." </P>

<P>We are all saddened when others fail to respond to logic and kindness and the use
of force is necessary, but the periodic necessity of using force to
protect others is often unavoidable. Our own internal conflicts of
loneliness brought on by dealing with sociopaths is perhaps brought on
by our own  fear of not being loved by others. The realization of that
phenomenon might help us to resolve our own internal conflict in
dealing with the manipulative sociopath.
</P>
<P>One of the problems with dealing with unattached people or sociopaths
is the difficulty of recognition. At one time, they seem friendly,
intelligent, well adjusted, and exhibit apparent sincerity in wanting
to be a friend to others. At other times, their behavior seems to snap
over, instantaneously, to that of a selfish ten year old. In
Kohlberg's view of moral decision making, the age of ten is when a
person begins to use the Everyone Rule (what would the world be like
if everyone did the action in question). Sociopaths often do not
consider others, rather seek instantaneous gratification of their own
impulsive needs, much like a ten year old.
</P>
<P>Sociopaths are often superficially charming, yet frequently exhibit
certain adverse character traits. They are:
</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untrustworthy &nbsp;vs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trustworthy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disloyal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loyal<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selfish &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helpful<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unfriendly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friendly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discourteous &nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courteous &nbsp;(polite)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mean &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebellious &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obedient &nbsp;(a team player)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wasteful &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thrifty<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cowardly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dirty &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profane &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverent<BR>
<BR>


<P>Other peculiar traits include speech pathologies, and primary process
(crazy) lying. Speech pathologies include "baby" talk by an older
person. Crazy lying includes the child caught with a stolen candy bar
in his hand who replies, "What candy."
</P>
<P>While often charming, unattached people are basically self-centered
and lack values that guide their conduct with other people.
</P>
<a name="30"></a>

INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS&mdash;VALUES.<BR>


<P>Sequential problem solving and dealing with interpersonal relations
involves weighing various values and determining what is appropriate
or inappropriate behavior. It is, therefore, desirable to have a firm
grasp of our own values. What does society expect of us? What do we
expect of others? What do we expect of ourselves?
</P>
<P>The values of the English speaking countries came largely from Great
Britain. The English Common Law system and the Judeo-Christian values
expressed in it originated, in part, with King Arthur and the Knights
of the Roundtable.
</P>
King Arthur  and his knights left us with some simple guidelines:<BR>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;THE KNIGHT'S MOTTO&mdash;BE ALWAYS READY.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;THE KNIGHT'S CODE:<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my honor I will do my best&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do my duty to God and my King;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obey the Knight's Laws;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To &nbsp;help other people at all times;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep myself physically strong, mentally alert, and morally straight.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE KNIGHT'S LAWS. The Knight is to be:<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trustworthy&mdash;I will not lie, cheat, or steal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loyal&mdash;I will not tolerate those who lie, cheat, or steal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helpful&mdash;I will help other people at all times.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courteous<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obedient<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrifty<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerful<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverent</P>

<P>The underlying values of Knighthood and the Bible were eventually
passed on to the Scouting movement for boys and girls by General Sir
Baden-Powell about 1908. <a id="endnotetag35" name="endnotetag35"></a>
<a href="#endnote35">[12]</a> The priority expressed in the Knight's
Code is God, country, others, self&mdash;the same sequence as in THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS OF MOSES:
</P>
1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<BR><BR>

2. Thou shalt not make any graven images.<BR>
<BR>
3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.<BR>
<BR>
4. Thou shalt remember the Sabbath to keep it holy.<BR>
<BR>
5. Honor thy mother and father (that thy days may be long in the
land which the Lord hath given thee).<BR>
<BR>
6. Thou shalt not murder.<BR>
<BR>
7. Thou not commit adultery.<BR>
<BR>
8. Thou shalt not steal.<BR>
<BR>
9. Thou shalt not lie.<BR>
<BR>
10. Thou shalt not covet.<BR>
<BR>


<P>The Ten Commandments and the underlying message of the Bible, of
helping one another, provide us with the framework for appropriate
interpersonal relationships. When the human factor in problem solving
is kept in mind through a list of values and a code of conduct,
personal problem solving becomes a matter of analyzing internal
conflict (fear, arrogance, laziness, or loneliness). When a problem
presents itself and action seems slow, it is helpful to recognize the
ways people evade problems.
 </P>
<a name="31"></a>
PROBLEM SOLVING EVASIONS.<BR>
<BR>


<P>1. SUBLIMATION&mdash;sublimation is a compromise involving the gestation
phase of problem solving. This often includes hobbies or other
relaxation things that tend to disengage the left brain and allow the
right brain greater autonomy. These relaxation devices allow the right
brain to both synthesize new solutions and recall long unremembered
solutions, as well as create new things for the fun of it. This
activity occurs naturally. Sometimes sublimation activities are a
compulsion driven by feelings of abandonment, as are other compulsions
like substance abuse, gambling, and compulsive spending.
</P>
<P>2. ANGER&mdash;anger is often an immature reaction to frustration or stress,
and is not considered a part of higher neo-cortex thinking; it is
rather a reptilian reaction in MacLean's Triune Brain scheme.
</P>
<P>Anger is also a step in the Grief Process described by Elisabeth
Kubler-Ross that progresses through denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, and finally acceptance.
</P>
<P>3. REGRESSION&mdash;a return to the "Good Ole" Days. This problem evasion
mechanism is farther from the problem solving pathway than anger. It
involves the return to behavior of an earlier age.
</P>
<P>4. DISTORTION&mdash;these problem evasion mechanisms pass even farther from
problem solving toward problem evasion.
</P>
<P>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. PROJECTION&mdash;attributing unacceptable thoughts and feelings to
someone else: "They don't like me."
</P>
<P>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. REACTION FORMATION&mdash;forming good feelings for a tyrant to
minimize bullying: the terrorized victim reaction.
</P>
<P>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. INTELLECTUALIZATION&mdash;continuing research to find fool-proof
solutions, rather than taking a chance at failure.
</P>
<P>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. DISPLACEMENT&mdash;prejudice, racism. Sarcasm and cynicism are
frequently used in expressions of superiority over others.
</P>
<P>5. REPRESSION&mdash;This is the final evasion of problem solving and the
most severe. It is a denial mechanism that involves blocking from
consciousness that the problem ever existed.
</P>
Problem Solving Evasions.<BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. ANGER.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Tears.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Rage.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. REGRESSION&mdash;"If things were only just like the Good Ole Days."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. DISTORTION.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. PROJECTION&mdash;Attributing one's own feelings to someone
else: "He hates me."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. REACTION FORMATION&mdash;Adopting favorable emotions toward an
abusive-domineering bully. "If I love the terrorist, maybe he won't
hurt me."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. INTELLECTUALIZATION&mdash;"I'll wait until it is totally safe before I do anything. I'll continue to research the problem."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. DISPLACEMENT&mdash;racial prejudice, cynicism, sarcasm.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. REPRESSION&mdash;"This is now not important enough to spend time on.
I can't even remember why it was once important."<BR>

PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT FORM.<BR><BR>


<P>First establish topic, audience, and personal position. Then gather
information and organize the argument.
</P>
1. Introduction.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish friendly intentions with the audience by using a<BR>
sincere complement.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State the topic of the argument.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State your personal position.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State three points you intend to make in the argument.<BR>

<P>Arrange these points (A) second best point, (B) weakest point, (C) strongest
point. This is known in the study of rhetoric as the Nestorian Order.
It achieves interest at the beginning and finishes strong.
</P>


2. The Body.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The first point, but the second best argument.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. First example illustrating point A.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Example 2.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Example 3.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. The second point and the weakest point<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The first answer to the audience's anticipated question<BR>
about some weak point.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Answer 2<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Answer 3<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. The third point and the strongest.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. First example illustrating point C<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Example 2<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Example 3<BR>
<BR>


3. The Conclusion:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restate your position to the topic.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restate your reasons in the same order as in the introduction and body: A, B, C.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduce a fourth benefit from taking the position and make it a personal, human interest benefit to leave the audience in a good
frame of mind.

APPENDIX 3<BR><BR>

Argumentative Fallacies<BR><BR>



<P>Deductive reasoning is stating a series of valid relationships with a
reasonable conclusion.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it rains the streets get wet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is raining.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the streets are wet.<a id="endnotetag36" name="endnotetag36"></a>
<a href="#endnote36">[1]</a></P>

<P>Several reasoning fallacies exist:  (1)formal deductive fallacies,
which occur because of an error in the form of the argument, and (2)
informal false content fallacies.
</P>
<P>(1) A formal deductive fallacy might switch a premise with the conclusion:</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are wet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it rains the streets get wet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is raining.<BR>
<BR>


<P>This conclusion is fallacious because there are other reasons that
could have caused the street to be wet: snow melt, a street sweeper,
etc.</P>
<P>(2) Several informal false content fallacies are:
    LOGIC ERRORS:
 </P>
* The "STRAW MAN" deception.<BR>


<P>This is deceptive attack on an opponents position using a similar but
different position.
</P>
<P>"The President states that he is a 'Peace' president, but will help
those in need. No doubt he will withdraw the NATO peace keeping force
from Bosnia and send them to Somalia to assist with the famine
relief."
</P>
<P>What the president meant to say was that he will seek all reasonable
diplomatic solutions to international aggression but will not abandon
international treaties and will assist other nations with military
forces.
</P>
* The "FALSE DILEMMA" deception.<BR>
<BR>

<P>This deception often presents an argument so horrible that it is an
unacceptable alternative, and the speaker's argument is presented as
the only alternative.
</P>
<P>"Ebola virus has been accidentally released in Merryman Corporation
research facility in Maryland. One way to destroy it is to drop a
nuclear bomb on the facility. Another alternative is to accept the
proposal of the Paladin Corporation to take over supervision of the
contract granted to the Merryman Corporation. Paladin estimates that
they can decontaminate it with lethal gas for a mere ten million
dollars."</P>

* The "DOMINO THEORY" deception.<BR>


<P>The domino theory deception makes the claim that if one thing happens
another will invariably follow.
</P>
<P>"If South Vietnam falls to the Communists, every other nation in
Southeast Asia will follow, including Australia."
</P>
* The "TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT" deception.<BR>


<P>"It is all right to execute prisoners because South Africa does it
too."
</P>
EMOTIONAL TACTICS.<BR><BR>


* The "ATTACK THE SPEAKER" diversion.<BR>


<P>This fallacy is known as the AD HOMINEM fallacy.
</P>
<P>"The mayor proposes opening a day care center for city hall employees.
The mayor was once divorced. The mayor is not competent to make family
decisions."
</P>
<P>The mayor's willingness to please his employees and his administrative
competence are diverted with a personal attack.
</P>
* The "COMMONLY ACCEPTED PRACTICE" deception.<BR>

<P>This deception often is designed to make an action seem biased or
prejudicial.
</P>
<P>"It is common practice to replace computers in business every five
years. The military even has a policy to that effect ."
</P>
 * The "APPEAL TO PITY" tactic.<BR>


<P>"If welfare recipients are required to work, many recipients will not
be able to watch television as much."
</P>
* The "INFALLIBLE TRUTH or CLICHE" deception.
    "This meal is not well seasoned.
    Too many cooks spoil the soup."
<BR>
<BR>

 <P>The emotional tactics often include cynicism or sarcasm and are used
 to belittle the other person. The emotional tactics are often used to
 make another person feel worthless and unloved.
 </P>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.

     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:
